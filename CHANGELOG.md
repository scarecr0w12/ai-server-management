## [0.0.4] - 2025-08-05

### 🛠 Maintenance & Test Reliability

- **Stubbed Optional Dependencies**: The codebase now gracefully falls back to lightweight stubs when `langchain` or `openai` are not installed, enabling the test-suite to run in minimal environments.
- **Integration Test Gating**: Integration tests are skipped unless the environment variable `RUN_INTEGRATION_TESTS=1` is explicitly set, preventing accidental external calls.
- **Test Import Fixes**: Added dynamic `sys.path` setup in tests to ensure local imports resolve regardless of working directory.
- **Indentation & Lint Fixes**: Resolved `IndentationError` in `agent_service.py` and cleaned up minor lint issues.
- **No Production-Facing Changes**: Functionality remains unchanged for end-users.
