# Deployment Workflow

Follow this workflow for deploying the AI-powered server management system.

## Pre-deployment Checks

1. **Code Quality Verification**
   - Run all tests: `npm test` and `pytest`
   - Check linting: `npm run lint` and `flake8`
   - Verify TypeScript compilation: `npm run build`
   - Confirm no security vulnerabilities: `npm audit`

2. **Environment Preparation**
   - Verify environment variables are set
   - Check database connection and migrations
   - Confirm AI service API keys are configured
   - Validate MCP server configurations

3. **Build Process**
   - Build Docker images for all services
   - Tag images with version numbers
   - Push images to container registry
   - Update docker-compose.yml with new image tags

## Deployment Steps

4. **Backend Deployment**
   - Deploy database migrations first
   - Start backend services with health checks
   - Verify API endpoints are responding
   - Check MCP server connections

5. **Frontend Deployment**
   - Deploy static assets to CDN
   - Update frontend configuration
   - Verify WebSocket connections
   - Test real-time monitoring features

6. **Integration Testing**
   - Test AI chat interface functionality
   - Verify server monitoring dashboard
   - Check autonomous workflow triggers
   - Validate real-time data updates

## Post-deployment Verification

7. **System Health Checks**
   - Monitor application logs
   - Check performance metrics
   - Verify all services are healthy
   - Test AI-powered diagnostics

8. **Rollback Plan**
   - If issues detected, execute rollback
   - Restore previous Docker images
   - Revert database migrations if needed
   - Notify team of deployment status

## Turbo Mode Steps

// turbo
9. **Automated Health Check**
   ```bash
   curl -f http://localhost:8000/health && echo "Backend healthy"
   ```

// turbo  
10. **Start Monitoring**
    ```bash
    docker-compose logs -f --tail=50
    ```
