# Implementation Progress Report

## Phase 1: Enhanced LLM Features - SIGNIFICANT PROGRESS MADE

### ✅ Step 1: Conversation History & Context Management (COMPLETED)
**Backend Implementation:**
- Created conversation model with persistent storage (`conversation.model.ts`)
- Enhanced AI service with conversation-aware processing
- Added conversation management methods (create, get, update, delete)
- Implemented context tracking for server IDs, tasks, and diagnostic sessions

**Frontend Implementation:**
- Enhanced AI chat component with conversation sidebar
- Real-time conversation list with creation/deletion capabilities
- Context display with chips showing current task and conversation ID
- Persistent conversation switching with history loading

**Key Features Delivered:**
- Multi-turn conversations with full history
- Context preservation across sessions
- User-friendly conversation management UI
- Real-time WebSocket updates

### ✅ Step 2: Tool Calling & Function Integration (COMPLETED)
**Backend Implementation:**
- Created comprehensive server tools manager (`server-tools.ts`)
- Defined 7 server management tools:
  - `list_servers` - List all available servers
  - `get_server_status` - Get detailed server status
  - `connect_to_server` - Establish SSH connections
  - `run_server_command` - Execute commands on servers
  - `analyze_server_logs` - Retrieve and analyze logs
  - `check_system_resources` - Monitor CPU/memory/disk
  - `restart_service` - Restart system services
- Integrated OpenAI function calling in AI service
- Added tool execution handling with result processing

**Frontend Implementation:**
- Enhanced message display to show tool executions
- Tool execution indicators with success/failure status
- Arguments and results display for transparency
- Color-coded tool execution messages

**Key Features Delivered:**
- Autonomous server management capabilities
- Real-time tool execution feedback
- Transparent tool usage display
- Context-aware tool selection

## Current Status: Ready for Phase 1, Step 3

### Next Implementation Target: Enhanced Prompt Engineering

**Planned Features:**
1. **Dynamic Prompt Templates**
   - Context-specific prompt generation
   - Task-aware system message customization
   - Server-specific knowledge injection

2. **Multi-Step Reasoning Chains**
   - Complex problem decomposition
   - Step-by-step diagnostic workflows
   - Reasoning trace display

3. **Adaptive Context Management**
   - Smart context window management
   - Automatic context summarization
   - Relevance-based message filtering
