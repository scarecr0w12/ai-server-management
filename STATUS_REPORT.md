# Server Management System with AI Integration - Status Report

## Current Status

The Server Management System with AI Integration project has successfully completed its initial setup and configuration phase. Both frontend and backend components are functional and can start correctly.

## Completed Work

### Environment Setup
- Resolved all dependency issues for both frontend and backend
- Created and configured environment files
- Installed all required TypeScript type definitions
- Fixed development and test scripts

### Core Implementation
- React + TypeScript frontend with Material-UI components
- Node.js + Express backend with Socket.io integration
- OpenAI API integration for AI-powered diagnostics
- Server diagnostics with SSH connection capabilities
- Basic MCP connection component

### Documentation
- Comprehensive README with project overview
- Detailed advanced features plan (ADVANCED_FEATURES_PLAN.md)
- Project summary (SUMMARY.md)
- Status report (STATUS_REPORT.md)

## Verification
Both frontend and backend have been verified to start correctly, with proper handling of port conflicts.

## Next Steps

1. Begin implementation of advanced LLM features:
   - Conversation history tracking
   - Tool calling capabilities
   - Enhanced prompt templates

2. Implement full MCP protocol integration:
   - Backend MCP server capabilities
   - Frontend with real protocol connection
   - Resource browsing interface

3. Develop agentic diagnostic workflows

4. Add autonomous server management features

## Technical Debt

- Fix TypeScript errors related to 'error' variable being typed as 'unknown' in backend
- Add proper error handling and validation
- Implement database integration for persistent storage
- Add user authentication and authorization

This status report confirms that the project is ready to move into the advanced feature implementation phase.
