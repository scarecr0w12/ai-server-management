# Full System Evaluation

_Last updated: 2025-08-05_

## 1. Completed Features

* Conversation history & context management
* Tool calling with OpenAI function integration and 7 server-management tools
* React/TypeScript frontend with chat UI, WebSocket real-time communication
* Basic backend AI service, modular services, error handling skeleton
* Docker-ready containerisation and CI skeleton

---

## 2. Unfinished / In-Progress Features

| Area | Status | Notes |
|------|--------|-------|
| **Enhanced Prompt Engineering** | üöß In Progress | Dynamic templates, multi-step reasoning chains not yet implemented |
| **Real MCP Protocol Integration** | ‚ùå Not Started | Backend MCP server & real frontend integration pending |
| **Agentic Workflows** | ‚ùå Not Started | Autonomous diagnostic & server-management workflows pending |
| **Memory & Learning System** | ‚ùå Not Started | Persistent memory, knowledge-base, preference storage |
| **Multi-Model Integration** | ‚ùå Not Started | Support for additional LLM providers |

---

## 3. Uncompleted Code / Technical Debt

* **Logging system:** Centralised structured logging still missing.
* **TypeScript `unknown` errors:** Some backend files still use `unknown` types; needs cleanup.
* **Unit & Integration Tests:** Very limited coverage; tests need to be written for core services and React components.
* **Error Handling & Validation:** Extend try/catch and validation across API endpoints.
* **Port Configuration Checks:** Ensure all configs respect fixed ports (frontend `4000`, backend `5000`).
* **TODO / FIXME sweep:** No open TODOs in project source, but confirm during code reviews.

---

## 4. Future Development Opportunities

* Performance optimisation & scaling (caching, load balancing).
* Security hardening (auth, rate-limiting, secrets management).
* Server provisioning & auto-healing workflows.
* Monitoring dashboards & alerting hooks.
* Workflow visualisation and editing UI.
* Packaging as deployable SaaS offering.

## 5. Prioritised Next Steps

1. Finish **Enhanced Prompt Engineering** (Phase-1 Step-3).
2. Implement **Real MCP Protocol** backend & swap simulated frontend.
3. Design and build **Agentic Workflows** engine + workflow files.
4. Establish **Memory System** leveraging Windsurf memory MCP.
5. Add rigorous **tests**, logging, and error-handling.
6. Plan for **Phase-4** advanced multi-model support.
